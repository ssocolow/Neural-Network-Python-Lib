# Neural-Network-Python-Lib
A neural network library implemented in python with support for multiple layers, different activation functions, and gradient descent.
Inspired and made possible by The Coding Train's Neural Network playlist and 3 Blue 1 Brown's Neural Network playlist:

## Quick Start
Clone this repository by making an empty directory and putting this code in it by downloading or copying and pasting or with:
`git clone https://github.com/ssocolow/Neural-Network-Python-Lib.git`

After you have the code, read example.py as it shows how to use the library.
Hopefully, a more comprehensive guide and documentation will be made soon.
