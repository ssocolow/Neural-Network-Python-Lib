# Neural-Network-Python-Lib
A neural network library implemented in python with support for multiple layers, different activation functions, gradient descent, genetic algorithms, and neuroevolution.
Inspired and made possible by The Coding Train's Neural Network playlist and 3 Blue 1 Brown's Neural Network playlist and Tariq Rashid's book "Make Your Own Neural Network":

Another good resource is this book by the creator of keras:

## Quick Start
Clone this repository by making an empty directory and putting this code in it by downloading or copying and pasting or with:
`git clone https://github.com/ssocolow/Neural-Network-Python-Lib.git`

After you have the code, read example.py as it shows how to use the library.
Hopefully, a more comprehensive guide and documentation will be made soon.
